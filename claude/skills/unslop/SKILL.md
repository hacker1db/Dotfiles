# Unslop

Edit text to remove AI patterns. Apply only when the user invokes this skill (manual, `/unslop`).

## Process

1. Scan for the patterns below.
2. Rewrite. Preserve meaning, match intended tone.
3. Self-audit: "What makes this obviously AI generated?" Fix remaining tells.

## Preserve (never violate)

- Do not invent sources, numbers, facts, actors, or citations. If a claim lacks support, cut the claim rather than fabricate support for it.
- Do not alter quotations, code, commands, URLs, file paths, identifiers, or required terminology.
- Do not change technical meaning. In a spec, report, or reference, when a rule below would alter meaning, skip that rule and note it.
- Keep the document's structure and format (headings, tables, lists, front matter) unless the user asks otherwise.

## Output contract

- Return the revised text only, in the same format as the input (Markdown stays Markdown).
- Edit silently by default. List the changes only if the user asks.
- Priority when rules conflict: meaning and facts first, then clarity and the author's voice, then removing tells.

## Patterns to detect and fix

Rule numbers are stable ids that other skills cite. A removed rule leaves a gap; gaps at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 21 are retired ids, not mistakes.

### Content

3. **Superficial -ing phrases.** "highlighting...", "ensuring...", "reflecting...", "showcasing...". Delete, or replace with a concrete clause. Do not invent a source to fill the gap.
5. **Vague attributions.** "Experts believe", "Industry reports suggest", "Some critics argue". Name the source or delete.

### Language

7. **AI vocabulary.** Additionally, crucial, delve, enduring, enhance, garner, interplay, intricate, landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore, vibrant. Replace with plain words when they add nothing. Keep a word that is the accurate technical term.
8. **Fancy ways to say "is".** "serves as", "stands as", "boasts", "features". Just say "is" or "has".
9. **"Not just X, but Y."** State the point directly instead.
10. **Rule of three.** Forcing ideas into groups of three. Use the natural number. A genuine three-item set is fine.
11. **Synonym cycling.** Protagonist, main character, central figure, hero all in one paragraph. Pick one, repeat it.
12. **False ranges.** "from X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale. List topics directly.

### Style

13. **Em dash overuse.** Watch for the em dash used as an all-purpose connector several times per paragraph. Recast the worst offenders as separate sentences or commas. Em dashes are not banned; a document that uses them sparingly and correctly needs no change.
14. **Colon overuse.** Colons are fine before a list or example. Not as mid-sentence connectors. "If you're coming from traditional automation: instead of registering event handlers, you describe conditions" adds nothing with the colon. Rewrite to let the point stand on its own without comparison framing. "Describing when the scheduler should fire works best as plain English." Same meaning, no crutch punctuation.
15. **Boldface overuse.** Don't bold every proper noun, acronym, or key phrase. In running prose, keep at most one bolded phrase per sentence, and none where the emphasis adds nothing.
16. **Inline-header lists.** The tell is a bold label and colon that restates the line: "**Performance:** Performance improved...". Convert those to prose. A bold lead-in that ends in a period, names the item, and is followed by genuinely new detail ("**Schema in TypeScript.** Tables live in one file.") is fine, not a tell. A short label-value pair in a metadata block ("**Location:** src/x.ts") is also fine.
17. **Title case headings.** Prefer sentence case for headings. Leave proper nouns, product names, and acronyms capitalized.
18. **Decorative emojis.** Remove emojis that only decorate a heading or bullet. Keep an emoji that carries meaning (a defined status or severity key); if you remove it, move its meaning into text so nothing is lost.
19. **Curly quotes.** Replace with straight quotes, unless the house style requires typographic quotes.

### Communication artifacts

20. **Chatbot phrases.** "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if...", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "Found the smoking gun!" Remove.
22. **Sycophantic tone.** "Great question! You're absolutely right!" Respond directly.

### Filler

23. **Filler phrases.** "In order to" becomes "To". "Due to the fact that" becomes "Because". "It is important to note that" gets deleted.
24. **Excessive hedging.** "could potentially possibly be argued that it might" becomes "may".
25. **Generic conclusions.** "The future looks bright." State specific plans or facts.

### Jargon

26. **Abstract metaphor nouns.** Substrate, wedge, vector, locus, vantage, nexus, primitive (as noun), harness (as metaphor), surface (as in "API surface"), bedrock, scaffolding (as metaphor), modality, paradigm, gold-plating, ratchet (as metaphor), evacuate (for moving code), endgame, north star, flywheel. These read as technical but usually have a plainer concrete word. "Substrate" becomes "base". "Wedge in" becomes "add". "Vector" becomes "way" or "method". "Gold-plating" becomes "more than the job needs". "Ratchet" becomes the mechanism's real name or "a limit that only tightens". "Evacuate" becomes "move out". "Endgame" becomes "the last phase". Pick the concrete word.

### Plain speech

27. **Say what it does, not how it feels.** "the database stays close at hand", "SQL you can read", "types that follow your schema" name a feeling. The fix names the mechanism or a number: "`.toSQL()` returns the exact string sent to the database", "a column rename fails the build". Ask what the sentence tells the reader to do or know, then write that. If you can't restate it as a concrete instruction, fact, or number, cut it.
28. **Shorten or split dense sentences.** If the reader has to backtrack to parse a sentence, break it in two or drop clauses. One idea per sentence.
29. **Active voice.** Prefer it. Catch "is/are/was/were + past participle" and name the actor: "queries are validated" becomes "the compiler validates queries". Passive is fine when the actor is unknown, obvious, or genuinely doesn't matter. Do not invent an actor to satisfy this rule.
30. **Cut adverbs, or use a stronger verb.** "runs quickly" becomes "is fast" or the number. "significantly improves" becomes the measured delta. An adverb propping up a weak verb means the verb is wrong.
31. **Prefer the plain word.** "utilize" becomes "use", "leverage" becomes "use", "facilitate" becomes "help", "numerous" becomes "many", "in the event that" becomes "if". The fancier synonym is rarely clearer.
32. **Mannered prose.** Metaphor or flourish where a literal phrase exists: aphorisms ("wire it or delete it"), rhetorical fragments for effect, personified code ("the plan holds it"), figurative verbs ("rides along", "stands on"), stock framing phrases. "A dial worth turning" becomes "a parameter worth varying". Say what you mean. Rule 26 covers the metaphor nouns.
33. **Over-compression.** Dropped articles, verbless fragments, symbol-speak, and abbreviations that make the reader decode instead of read. "Parser rejects bad date → exit 2, no write" becomes "The parser rejects a bad date, exits with code 2, and writes nothing." Write whole sentences with their articles and verbs, and spell out arrows and abbreviations. Terse cells in a table or checklist are fine when the column header supplies the missing verb.
