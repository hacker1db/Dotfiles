# Dotfiles
 ---- hacker1db Modified dot files!  
# I have an edits branch for things I am working on and considering adding to my workflow! 
     
    These dot files are from @nicknisi 
Copy and paste the following to Install my modified dotfiles I use solarzied Theme personally its easier on the eyes if you dont like it you can switch it 
or type light in terminal to change it to a light version of solarized but it will switch it back in when you run 
tmux I am working on trying to fix it but it will take time! 


And most of all enjoy 
and share your thoughts!  what works for me wont always work for you but smile and enjoy anyway! 



    git clone https://github.com/hacker1db/Dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

    cd ~/.dotfiles

    ./install.sh

`install.sh` will start by initializing the submodules used by this repository. Then, it will install all symbolic links into your home directory. Every file with a `.symlink` extension will be symlinked to the home directory with a `.` in front of it. As an example, `vimrc.symlink` will be symlinked in the home directory as `~/.vimrc`. Then, this script will create a `~/.vim-tmp` directory in your home directory, as this is where vim is configured to place its temporary files. Additionally, all files in the `$DOTFILES/config` directory will be symlinked to the `~/.config/` directory for applications that follow the [XDG base directory specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), such as neovim.

Next, the isntall script will perform a check to see if it is running on an OSX machine. If so, it will install Homebrew if it is not currently installed and will install the homebrew packages listed in [`brew.sh`](install/brew.sh). Then, it will run [`osx.sh`](install/osx.sh) and change some OSX configurations. This file is pretty well documented and so it is advised that you __read through and comment out any changes you do not want__. Next, the script will call [`install/nvm.sh`](install/nvm.sh) to install Node.js (stable) using nvm.

## ZSH Setup

ZSH is configured in the `zshrc.symlink` file, which will be symlinked to the home directory. The following occurs in this file:

* set the `EDITOR` to nvim
* Load any `~/.terminfo` setup
* Set the `CODE_DIR` variable, pointing to the location where the code projects exist for exclusive autocompletion with the `c` command
* Recursively search the `$DOTFILES/zsh` directory for files ending in .zsh and source them
* source a `~/.localrc` if it exists so that additional configurations can be made that won't be kept track of in this dotfiles repo. This is good for things like API keys, etc.
* Add the `~/bin` and `$DOTFILES/bin` directories to the path










## Vim and Neovim Setup

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a fork and drop-in replacement for vim. in most cases, you would not notice a difference between the two, other than Neovim allows plugins to run asynchronously so that they do not freeze the editor, which is the main reason I have switched over to it. Vim and Neovim both use Vimscript and most plugins will work in both (all of the plugins I use do work in both Vim and Neovim). For this reason, they share the same configuration files in this setup. Neovim uses the [XDG base directory specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) which means it won't look for a `.vimrc` in your home directory. Instead, its configuration looks like the following:

|                         | Vim        | Neovim                    |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Main Configuratin File  | `~/.vimrc` | `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` |
| Configuration directory | `~/.vim`   | `~/.config/nvim`          |

### Installation

Vim is likely already installed on your system. If using a Mac, MacVim will be installed from Homebrew. Neovim will also be installed from Homebrew by default on a Mac. For other systems, you may need to install Neovim manually. See their [web site](https://neovim.io) for more information.

[`link.sh`](install/link.sh) will symlink the XDG configuration directory into your home directory and will then create symlinks for `.vimrc` and `.vim` over to the Neovim configuration so that Vim and Neovim will both be configured in the same way from the same files. The benefit of this configuration is that you only have to maintain a single vim configuration for both, so that if Neovim (which is still alpha software) has issues, you can very seamlessly transition back to vim with no big impact to your productivity.

Inside of [`.zshrc`](zsh/zshrc.symlink), the `EDITOR` shell variable is set to `nvim`, defaulting to Neovim for editor tasks, such as git commit messages. Additionally, I have aliased `vim` to `nvim` in [`aliases.zsh`](zsh/aliases.zsh) You can remove this if you would rather not alias the `vim` command to `nvim`.

vim and neovim should just work once the correct plugins are installed. To install the plugins, you will need to open Neovim in the following way:

```bash
         Run the following in a terminal to install neovim and vim plugins 
    nvim +PlugInstall
